## Project Description
Economic indicators such as the ones provided by the United States Census Bureau often act as useful insights into the economic health of the nation. Construction spending has been shown to be closely correlated with the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and forecasting these statistics could provide investment firms an effective methodology for deploying capital for maximal returns. This analysis aims to accurately predict total construction spending as an annual forecast for the purposes of allocating investment funds.
